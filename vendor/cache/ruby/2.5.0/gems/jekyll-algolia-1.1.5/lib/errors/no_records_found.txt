W: The plugin tried to extract records from the pages, posts and collections of
W: your site but could not find anything to index.

I: Make sure you did not exclude too many files from indexing using the
I: `files_to_exclude` option. You are currently excluding the following files:
I:     {files_to_exclude}
I:
I: Also double check that your current value for `nodes_to_index` can actually
I: match something in the pages. You are current indexing the following nodes:
I:     {nodes_to_index}
I:
I: Note that all the markup that is defined in the layouts won't be available 
I: during extraction. Only the page content can be accessed. So if you defined
I: a layout markup that is used only for one page, you should move it to the 
I: page instead.
