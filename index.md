I am a computer vision research engineer working with the visual understanding team at Samsung Research, Bangalore. I graduated from BITS Pilani with a degree in computer science and a prediliction for Mathematics. On one hand my interest lies in exact abstractions like logic and data structures, while on the other I enjoy playing with leaky abstractions like machine learning and statistics.

I have whipped this website up to share some of my more concrete notes and thoughts that come up in my technical journey. My treatment of subjects will be as formal and rigorous as my engineering intellect allows, read pretty informal. The articles which warrant more structure, detail and reach will be published on my Medium [blog][medium-blog-profile], do check it out!

### Disclaimer

This website is still under construction.

- Please report bugs by raising issues in [this][source-repo] repository.
- github-pages doesn't allow you to publish source from any branch other than master. Further, I constructed the first versions of this website as a newbie coder, so the commit history is abominable.
