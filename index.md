I am a machine learning engineer working with the visual understanding team at Samsung Research, Bangalore. I have graduated from BITS Pilani as a computer science engineer with a penchant for Mathematics. On one hand my interest lies in exact abstractions like logic and data structures, while on the other hand I like playing with leaky abstractions like machine learning and statistics.

This website is still under construction. If you find a bug, raise an issue at https://github.com/jbnerd/jbnerd.github.io

- Check out the posts section for some of my short notes and thoughts. I'll use Medium for topics that require more details and completeness.
- github-pages doesn't allow you to publish your source from any other branch than master, so the commit history is abominable. DON'T JUDGE!
