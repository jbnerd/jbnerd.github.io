<h1> About Me </h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p><big>I'm a Junior student at Birla Institute Technology and Science, Pilani pursuing Engineering in Computer Science. I am a keen learner and a careful observer in every field I come across. I like to keep Exploring and Learning something new everyday. I believe that there is a lot to learn even from the smallest of things around me.</big></p>


<h2>Me as a Person</h2>
        <p><big>I am particularly interested in Logic based thinking and Problem Solving. Spotting Patterns and Relations comes to me very naturally and I have a great knack of visualization. It helps me develop my knowledge in a greater depth. I am good at explaining various phenomena based on simple analogies for clarification of concepts. I have a habit of pondering over answers to a myriad of questions of human consciousness and existence. I often find myself astounded by the thinking styles of the great minds that have shaped the history and the science of today.</big></p>
