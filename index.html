<h1> About Me </h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a Junior at Birla Institute Technology and Science, Pilani pursuing Engineering in Computer Science. I am a keen learner and a careful observer in every field that I come across. I like to keep Exploring and Learning something new everyday. I believe that there is a lot to learn even from the smallest of things around me.</p>

<h2>What are my Research Interests?</h2>
		<p>I have extensively worked in various sub-fields of Data Analytics including Natural Language Processing, Stream Mining and Mathematical Modelling. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in techniques addressing problems of Artificial Intelligence. I am typically interested in finding out how an Intelligent agent <strong>learns</strong> and so I have explored the use of Deep Learning in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. In the future I want to work and contribute towards the development of a Universal AI agent.</p>

<h2>What is my thinking approach?</h2>
        <p>I am particularly interested in Logic based thinking and Problem Solving. Spotting Patterns and Relations comes to me very naturally as I have a knack of visualization. It helps me develop my knowledge in a greater depth. I am good at explaining various phenomena based on simple analogies for clarification of concepts. I have a habit of pondering over answers to a myriad of questions on human consciousness and existence. I often find myself astounded by the thinking styles of the great minds that have shaped the history and the science of today.</p>

<h2>What do I do in my free time?</h2>
        <p>I have a talent for table tennis, self taught in free time. I also have a soft spot for Role Playing Computer Games since my childhood. Watching mind-intense movies and TV series is my favourite pastime. At other times I employ my programming skills to test by solving the Problems offered by Project Euler and Matasano's Cryptopals.</p>
