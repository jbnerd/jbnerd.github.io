<p>Checkmate is BITS Pilani's revolutionary quizzing event, where the participant's aptitude for analytical thinking and logic based problem solving is put to test. Hosted on a web based platform, it is conducted by the chapter in the fall semester of every academic year. The theme idea for September 2016 Checkmate was derived from the then popular game version japanese anime, POKEMON.</p>
