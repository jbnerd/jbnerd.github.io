excerpt: "QuickSort is one of my favourite algorithms proposed by [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) in 1959. The elegance of this algorithm is shrouded by the gory details of cache-aware partitioning schemes and complexity analysis when introduced in academia. The background image depicts my opinion on how QuickSort **should** be taught to a beginner."
