<p>I have been working under <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rahulbanerjee/profile">Prof. Rahul Banerjee</a> in the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/WearablePervasiveNetworkingLaboratory">Network Research Lab</a> of BITS Pilani for the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home">project</a>.</p>

<p>There are various sub-teams working on different aspects of the projects. One team is working on the Driving Simulator to collect the Physiological Data, another on Sensor Fusion of the Body Area Network and yet another one on Time Series Analysis of the physiological data that is being received from the sensors. My work was majorly on the Stream Mining of the physiological data to classify whether the driver is stressed or not. Most of which was a literature review of real time Data Mining techniques which can do a good job of classification without the knowledge of true labels of all the data.</p>
