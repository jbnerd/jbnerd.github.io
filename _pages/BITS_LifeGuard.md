<p>I have been working under <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rahulbanerjee/profile">Prof. Rahul Banerjee</a> in the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/WearablePervasiveNetworkingLaboratory">Network Research Lab</a> of BITS Pilani for the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home">project</a>. Find more information regarding the research project <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are various sub-teams working on different aspects of the projects. One team is working on the Driving Simulator to collect the Physiological Data, another on Sensor Fusion of the Body Area Network and yet another one on Time Series Analysis of the physiological data that is being received from the sensors.</p>

<p>My work majorly consisted of a literature review for techniques of real time classification of stream data. The data is cleaned by the sensor fusion team and is received by compute nodes on the jacket which have a very limited computational power and memory. Within these tight constraints the system should be able to detect whether a driver is under stress or not, and if there is a necessity of over-riding/alerting the driver of his stress levels. The true labels of the physiological data are unknown except for some points, which makes it even more difficult to perform the classification task.</p>
